<DIV style="overflow:auto;width:100%;height:200px;">
<DIV><FONT style="font-size:9pt;color:#880088;font-family:tahoma;">And now, the end is here
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and ev'ry highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way,
"Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way"

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>—— 这首歌是在1968年由Paul Anka等人根据著名的法文歌曲重新填词而成。猫王也唱过，但是我还是喜欢Frank Sinatra的演绎。当98年我看《燕尾蝶》时再次听到，竟然泪流满面！人生的经验不单单来自自己的经历。电影和故事如果你设身其中一样会有感触。对我而言，困境中的挣扎和奋斗是最能被触动的。</DIV>
