Stay hungry, Stay foolish.

> sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick
> 不要失去信仰
> don't loose faith
> 我很清楚唯一使我一直走下去的就是做我无比钟爱的事情
> I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did
> 你需要去找到你所爱的东西
> You've got to find what you love
> 这是一条适合于工作和爱情的信条
> And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers
> 你的工作将占据生活中很大的一部分
> Your work is going to fill a large part of your life
> 你只有相信自己所做的是伟大的工作你才能怡然自得
> And the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work
> 而成就伟大事业的唯一方式就是热爱你所做的
> And the only way to do great work is to love what you do
> 如果你现在还没有找到
> If you haven't found it yet
> 那么继续找，不要停下来
> Keep looking, and don't settle
> 只要全心全意去找
> As with all matters of the heart
> 在你找到的时候，你的心会告诉你的
> You'll know when you find it
> 就像任何真诚的关系
> And like any great relationship
> 只会随着岁月的流逝而变得越来越紧密
> It just gets better and better as the years roll on
> 所以继续找，不要停下来
> So keep looking, don't settle”</span>
